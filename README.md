This repository is based on the publication "Frequency and phase correction of GABA-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy using complex-valued convolutional neural networks" <br>
(doi: 10.1016/j.mri.2024.05.008) by Hanna Bugler, Rodrigo Berto, Roberto Souza and Ashley Harris (2024) <br>

The code provided in this repository is for the use of the ComplexCNN FPC model and to explore further details of our model's implementation. <br>

To use the ComplexCNN FPC model, users can process their data with the "ComplexCNN_FPC_Notebook.ipynb" file and download the .pt models from the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K4PS_r8-Z_I552pdTxLpYNVqKrYk68KR?usp=sharing <br>

To explore further details of our model's implementation <br>
The following code was used to train, validate, and test the ComplexCNN FPC model: simDataFPC.py, Datasets.py, modelsFPC.py, and mainTrainTest.py <br>
The following code was used for data analysis: analyzeDataFPC.py, metric_calculator.py, plotting.py <br>
The following code supports all remaining files: FPC_Functions.py <br>
The following link provides access to the simulated data: LINK <br>
